<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mHChlbqGMndYY/giphy.gif" width=500>

Over the next 5 days we would like you to build a Racing Game using your newfound powers as a stylish, jQuery-slinging, frontend developer. We want you to build not 1, not 2, but 3 different versions of your game (it's not as crazy as it sounds).

Please Fork & Clone this repo and use it as your starting point.

## Guidelines

* **Assigned:** Tuesday, Nov 24th
* **Due:** Monday, Nov 30th @ 9:17am

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we encourage you to get help from your peers and even pair-program on each other's projects when bugs arise.

**You must push your project to Github**, and we encourage you to also host it either using either <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> or <a href="https://www.bitballoon.com" target="_blank">BitBalloon</a>.

**You will receive written instructor feedback** on this project. See the [feedback doc](feedback.md) for details.

#### Minimum Viable Product
**A user should be able to...**

* See a beautiful **game board** on the page
* See at least **two players** on the board
* Press a key on their keyboard to **move their player**
* See the name of the **winner** of the round
* Be able to **reset the game** / start a new round

Please also attempt at least one bonus feature (or come up with your own!).

#### File Structure
* Please create a seperate folder for each of your games: `game-1`, `game-2`, `mad-scientist-game-3`. Remember, you're going to attempt to build three different racing games!
* You'll need an `index.html`, `main.css`, and `main.js`. Make sure your stylesheet and JavaScript files are linked in `index.html` (sanity check them!), and also include the CDNs you'll be using (e.g. Bootstrap, jQuery).

### Bonuses
You must complete all **core** requirements before moving on to bonuses.

Feel free to come up with your own bonus ideas & use your creativity. These are a few interesting challenges to stretch you:

* Integrate **Object Oriented Programming** design patterns.
* Keep track of **multiple game rounds** with a win counter / leader board.
* Allow **player customization** (e.g. pick a name/symbol/color/avatar).
* Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a> to **keep track of game state**, even if the user refreshes the page.
* Get creative with **inventive styling** (e.g. use css animations/transforms and hover effects, get creative with backgrounds).
* Display a **countdown timer** ("3, 2, 1, Go!"), the winning time, or the best time.
* **Race against a bot**.
* **Instant replay**: record yourself and then race against yourself, in real-time.
* Integrate with a **3rd party API**: flickr, youtube, spotify, giphy, etc.

### Best Practices
* Use **jQuery**
* Take very small steps
* **Wireframe** your page layout, and **whiteboard** the different components of your app (data, view/presentation logic, control logic, styles)
* Write **clean, well-indented code**! Follow this javascript [style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5). And make sure to remove unused/commented code!
* Minimize the use of global variables
* Abide by the **separation of concerns** principle with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
* Use **class-based css** rules & leverage CSS styling for a pleasing and logical user experience
* Stick with the **KISS** (Keep It Simple Stupid) and **DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
* **Commit early, and commit often**. Write commit messages that describe what you changed in each commit.
* Don't be afraid to **break your code**. Play in your console. Experiment.
* Write a helpful **`README.md`** that you or other developers can reference later. See [example-readme](example-readme.md) as a guide, and use this <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">markdown cheatsheet</a> to help with formatting.
