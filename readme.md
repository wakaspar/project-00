Racing Game

This is a small racing game I made for a WDI project.  Honestly, it didn't go very well.  I tried to be a little too clever, I think, and didn't discover the .animate() method until pretty late in the development game.  I think that, if I re-approached this project, I'd just use .animate() from the beginning and save myself a lot of time and heartache (and brainache).  Oh well, live and learn.  Here it is!
